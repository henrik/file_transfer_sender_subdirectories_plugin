README

In addition to the code in this repository, you need to add the linked frameworks

  * Adium.framework
  * AIUtilities.framework
  * FriBidi.framework

to the project directory. There is a compiled FriBidi.framework in the Frameworks directory of any Adium version checkout. Compile Adium to get compiled versions of Adium.framework and AIUtilities.framework in build/{Deployment|Development}.

See http://trac.adiumx.com/wiki/GettingReleaseAdiumSource for more info on checking out the Adium source.

See http://fadeover.org/blog/archives/25 for more info on writing Adium plugins.
