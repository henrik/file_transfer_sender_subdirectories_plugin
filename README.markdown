# FileTransferSenderSubdirectoriesPlugin

An Adium plugin that puts incoming files in per-sender subdirectories of the default directory.

Currently NOT compatible with Adium 1.3!

## Building

In addition to the code in this repository, you need to add the linked frameworks

  * Adium.framework
  * AIUtilities.framework
  * FriBidi.framework

to the project directory. Compile Adium to get compiled versions of these frameworks in build/{Deployment|Development}.

See <http://trac.adiumx.com/wiki/GettingReleaseAdiumSource> for more info on checking out the Adium source.

See <http://fadeover.org/blog/archives/25> for more info on writing Adium plugins.
